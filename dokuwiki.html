    <h2>DokuWiki</h2>

<p>I had the task of choosing a web-based tracking system for what I would call
semi-structured data. Generally speaking this was in the realm of a LIMS
(Laboratory Information Management System). However, the variation between
individual runs was great, and the nature of each run, and the tools around
them have a half-life of about 3 months. Therefore, I was loath to invest a lot
of time in polishing up a custom-fit solution, only to have it shatter into a
million pieces once the next wave of changes blew through.</p>

<p>Given the dynamic nature of the information, I investigated two CMSs
(<a href="http://plone.org">Plone</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>) and four Wikis
(<a href="http://moinmo.in">MoinMoin</a>, <a href="http://twiki.org">TWiki</a>,
<a href="http://www.pmwiki.org">PmWiki</a>, and <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org">DokuWiki</a>). Note,
the bar for this task was actually fairly low as the tracking tool this would
replace was the mighty <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>. Gee, I wonder how many times this
scenario has arisen?</p>

<p>Plone seemed a bit too much. I never really bothered trying to get my head
around the thing, since again, we&rsquo;re up against Excel, not, I don&rsquo;t know, Lotus
Notes?!</p>

<p>Drupal was a real gas and I got pretty far with it, after of course, adding the
&ldquo;Date&rdquo; module, the &ldquo;CCX&rdquo; module, the &ldquo;etc., etc.&rdquo; module. It&rsquo;s fun, but
ultimately fatiguing. I also worry about a system put together by clicking a
great deal. How does one do revision control on the thing?</p>

<p>And so that leaves the Wikis. I&rsquo;ve done a lot with Python and really like it,
so this should have been an easy win for MoinMoin. Something like a prize
fighter in a fixed fight. All you have to do is stand there for two rounds.
Unfortunately, MoinMoin would have nothing of it. In a fixed fight it finished
last. Kinda ugly, OK, but no real categories, namespaces, tags, broken search,
bad tables? Man. What is it about web software and Python v. PHP? It&rsquo;s
completely baffling.</p>

<p>Next up, the Perl one. The great one, TWiki. Sub-wikis good, search OK,
RCS-based, um, OK. A little hard on the eyes. Some general Perl mojo showing
through. Solid B.</p>

<p>Which leads us to the clear winners in the bunch. The ones based on PHP (just
like Drupal, WordPress, and MediaWiki). PmWiki is awfully nice. By far the best
looking (except tables are little off). Amazing search. The best syntax
extensions. One fundamental flaw, however. The pages are stored in text files,
that&rsquo;s good, but all the revisions are stored in the same file. Each revision
is a single line with the linefeeds within the bodies escaped as %0A&rsquo;s. In
other words, you&rsquo;ve got a near binary since you have to filter everything into
and out of the storage format! PASS.</p>

<p>Finally, DokuWiki. Really good table handling, good namespaces, nice looking,
almost too simple of an architecture, really. It indexes, it renders, it
caches, that&rsquo;s about it. The prize at the bottom of the box? Every page is
stored as a text file named <code>pagename + .txt</code>. Want to create 100 pages
off-line &amp; feed them to DokuWiki? Just put them in <code>data/pages</code> and run
<code>bin/indexer.php</code>, done. Winner: DokuWiki.</p>
