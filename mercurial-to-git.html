    <h2>They Got Me, I Cut Over from Mercurial to Git</h2>

<p>There was a certain inevitability about this moment. I&rsquo;m a big fan of C-based
tools and the Unix philosophy: <em>do one thing well</em>. <strong>Git</strong> exemplifies this.
<strong>Mercurial</strong>? Not really. Still, I had my reasons to resist.</p>

<ul>
<li>Familiarity. After progressing through <strong>CVS</strong> and <strong>Subversion</strong>, the command
set in <strong>Mercurial</strong> was a no-brainer. When it gets right down to it, how much
of your mental energy do you want to spend on version control? Not very much
right? <strong>Mercurial</strong> then, dammit.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>Python</strong>. <strong>Python</strong> is my favorite &ldquo;pretty darn good for all sorts of
problems&rdquo; language. A DVCS in <strong>Python</strong>, hey why not?</li>
<li>The <strong>Gibibyte</strong> thing. For some reason, <strong>Linux</strong> has embraced the
intellectually bankrupt notion of the kibi-, mebi-, gibi-byte thing. I really
hate this. The fact that every <strong>Git</strong> pull or push sticks this in your face is
really annoying.</li>
</ul>


<p>I first tried forking and modifying the output to remedy item 3. This seemed a
bit extreme, and instead I&rsquo;ve just learned to avert my eyes and fight back my
gag reflex.</p>

<p>Having made this step, I can start enjoying <strong>Git</strong>&rsquo;s advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Speed. Speed is addictive. You don&rsquo;t go back from speed.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a file system within a file system. You can do whatever you want with
it. It&rsquo;s your stuff after all. This just feels more natural than forever
appending to a &ldquo;I did this&rdquo; log.</li>
</ul>


<p>Like I said, this was inevitable.</p>
